# Stroke_Prediction_Analysis
## Aims to build a classification model that can provide a basic understanding of what types of personal characteristics are likely to cause stroke and the probability that those characteristics cause stroke.

The classification model can help doctors or
researchers to predict the risk of a person under the stroke once we input new data. We will also establish an unsupervised model, try to compress the dataset by identifying
which features are most useful in identifying different examples. We can
potentially discard the less significant ones for further analysis.

Though the modelâ€™s ability to provide accurate medical
diagnosis may be somewhat limited, it provides a sufficiently adequate platform for self check-up. Based on the analysis, we would recommend those people who are in
old age, with a higher BMI, suffering from heart disease and hypertension try to exercise
more and be aware of the risk of getting a stroke in advance. In addition, people who work in
the private sector and self-employees are also recommended for routinely taking relevant
physical examinations.
